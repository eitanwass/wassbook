It was a beautiful summer afternoon - clear blue sky, without a cloud in sight, and the smell of freshly cut grass hung in the air. A cool wind brushed against Hilda, carrying the scent of fruit trees and herbs growing in her field nearby. She sat in her rocking chair on the porch, a ginger cat curled up in her lap, purring as she hummed it a soft tune. \
Beside her, on the wooden deck, lied a small girl absorbed in a large hardcover book.

In a matter of seconds, the wind died out and the chirping of birds flying above them stopped. The hairs on Hilda's neck stood. She opened her eyes, and then she saw him - the Keeper. She had hoped this day would never come. Nevertheless, she was ready - and she was not afraid of him. \
He approached her, walking by the same bench they had first met almost fourteen years ago.  \
She had lived so much in those years, and lost a lot too. Her husband passed from a terrible illness he fought for months - almost taking her baby girl as well. After his death, Hilda took up his share of the responsibilities as well, and the added weight had left its marks on her. And yet, the Keeper looked exactly as he did all those years ago.

Hilda stood up to face him, as the cat jumped off of her lap, hissing at the approaching man. For a few moments, there was an unnatural stillness between them. \
"Hello, Keeper." Hilda broke the silence. \
"Hello, Hilda. I expect you know the reason for my return." \
"I do." She glanced at her girl, lying on the porch behind her, "We should go somewhere else to talk. Would you like to come inside for a cup of tea?" Hilda invited him calmly. \
"I would." \
As Hilda led him through the doorway, she caught him giving the girl a somber look.

Hilda gestured at a chair for the Keeper, and put a kettle on the stove. \
There was an awkward silence, broken only by the occasional crackle of the fire, stretching the tension in the air like a string - as thin as it can get without tearing. \
Then, the Keeper spoke hesitantly, "I see the years have been treating you well." \
"Yes, they have. My family and I are very grateful for that." Hilda responded with relief as time seemed to unpause. \
"It cannot last long now, until we proceed - unless the contract is fulfilled in its entirety. I believe you understand that." \
"I know. It's just..." Hilda let out a deep sigh and lowered her head "I hoped we'd have more time." \
"Let me be direct with you," he said and leaned deeper on his elbows "This is the first time I have been called to fulfill such a contract. I am not looking forward to doing that, and it weighs heavily on my shoulders." He said with a hint of what can only be interpreted as grief. \
A loud, metallic, shriek filled the room - making Hilda jump in her chair. Shaking herself out of the daze, she stood up to tend to the whistling kettle. \
Now refocused, Hilda decided to attempt swaying the Keeper's mind. "Then don't do it." She said, her back turned to the Keeper, while she scattered an assortment of leaves into the boiled water. \
"If I would not, the contract will become null and void." He began explaining. \
"Your land would die, " He continued, regained clarity and determination creeping into his tone. \
With her back still turned, Hilda's fingers closed around a kitchen knife's worn handle. The blade, which had split open countless vegetables - now might have to split flesh. \
"And it is safe to assume something would be taken from you as recompense - there is no way to know what." \
She tightened her grip, her knuckles white. If she struck first, if she was fast enough, she might never have to bear the Keeper's bidding. \
"But, I have given the situation a lot of thought since the last time we met." \
Hilda froze in reignited hope. \
"I am not sure, but although I was the one who notarized the contract, I am not strictly in charge of enforcing it." \
"What are you saying?" Hilda asked, still rigid and ready to strike. \
"I am saying there might be another option. I offer to take your child - under my wing. I will teach them to fight and fend for themselves. Hopefully, that would give them a better chance for survival." \
Hilda put down the knife quietly. In it's place she grabbed two mugs filled with tea, and placed them in the center of the round table. \
Gradually, suspicion took root in her mind. \
"Why would you do that?" She asked, her voice betraying her doubt. \
The Keeper tilted his head slightly. "I am offering your child a life - you would look a gift horse in the mouth?" \
Hilda persisted, "I have heard stories of you - serving, slaying, protecting, and helping, but always for a cost. I can't help but wonder what you would get out of this." \
The Keeper paused, weighing his response. \
"You are right to be suspicious. I would be too." His voice measured and calculated. \
"To put it plainly - by training the child, I have hope one day they will take my place as Keeper. And that I may finally retire." \
Hilda was taken aback, she stared into the room as she mulled over every possible option. After a long pause, she exhaled slowly, gave a small nod and whispered "Alright. I accept." \
The Keeper finished drinking his tea and stood up. "I will go speak with her now." He said and began walking towards the door.  \
"No!" With haste, Hilda grabbed his forearm, holding him back with unexpected force.  His hand felt frail, like a slender bone covered with fabric, a stark contrast to his large stature. \
The Keeper stopped, then turned, a fierce fire in his eyes. \
"I mean, she's not my firstborn." Hilda quickly pulled her hand away, her eyes dropping - in embarrassment she struggled to comprehend. "That would be her twin - Ward." She explained. \
"He is probably playing in the field now, but he should be back for dinner. Which, speaking of, " Hilda looked outside to see the sun setting, "I should start preparing." \
Hilda got up and started gathering various vegetables. \
The Keeper grunted, and sat back in his chair. "A twin, that is... unexpected." \
"Most people would say they are happy for me, would say I have been blessed." Hilda turned around, scowling, "Especially, given that you are going to take one of my children - that I would still have family." She said with an annoyed tone. \
"Yes, I am sorry." \
Hilda refilled their mugs, as they sat in silence, waiting for Ward to come home.

---

Ward was eight years-old when he first stumbled onto the bare clearing on their land. He had been idly daydreaming, wandering the edges of his mother's property, past the tended fields and onto the overgrowth, when he stepped into something different.  \
It was a circle of bone-dry dirt, stripped of grass and weeds - surrounded by stones, like the remains of a large long-dead campfire. \
As soon as he set foot inside, the world seemed to stop. The air turned still and charged with static that tingled against Ward's skin. The ever-present rustling of leaves and birds fell into silence. \
His focus was pulled to the center of the circle. Something was drawing him in - pushing forward, his legs waddling one hesitant step at a time.  \
Ward tried to gather his thought, but something kept pulling and ripping them apart.

I wanna go back - _'yet you follow'_ \
I want home. I want to mommy! - _'and you go'_ \
Mommy! - _'still I call'_

That's when the whispers began - words, overlapping and incoherent, screaming in deafening silence - they urged him forward. \
Though the voice echoes inside his head, it had a clear source: a blur, a mirage at the center of the stone ring. It mesmerized him, shifting in size, intensity, and color in a way he had never seen before. Without realizing it, Ward began walking towards it on his own volition - entranced. \
A part of him was curious - wanted to touch it. But it wouldn't let him. Instead, Ward dropped to his knees. An invisible, heavy hand pushing on his shoulder. He leaned forward, bracing himself on his hands, touching the dry land. It was warm - almost burning.  \
As if the ground felt him back, it started to pulsate, its rhythm matching Ward's heartbeat, until it the two thudded in unison.

Then, all at once, Ward felt free. In control. \
Still kneeling and trembling on the ground, heart pounding and breath rugged, he didn't stop to think, He just wanted to go home to his room, to his bed. \
So he ran. He ran as fast as he could. \
Ward never told his mother what happened. By the time he reached home, he wasn't sure it had even happened at all, and he decided to pretend it didn't.

A few years later, Ward was tending the wheat field. Working shirtless in the blazing sun, sweat dripping over his thick eyebrows into his eyes, he pulled a particularly stubborn patch of weeds he fell onto his back. As he began to stand up, a flicker of motion caught his eye. Between the golden stalks, a pair of red, menacing eyes stared back at him. \
It was a boar - and a big one. \
Ward froze. He knew better than to challenge it - wild boars were fast, strong, unpredictable, and terrifying when angered. He avoided eye contact and began slowly backing away, careful not to make a sound. \
But the boar shrieked without warning. It lunged through the straw with blazing speed. Ward dove to the side, barely escaping the tusks as they slashed past him. He hit the ground hard, dirt and stalks scraping his skin. \
As he scrambled to his feet, the boar was already turning, readying for another charge. Ward didn't wait - he ran.

Stalks of wheat whipped against his face and arms as he sprinted through the field, his lungs burning. He didn't know where he was going - just as far away and as fast as he could. \
Then, without thinking, he broke through the tree-line and into the clearing - the stone circle he had tried to forget. \
He skidded to stop at its edge - but the boar didn't. \
It charged after him, only to stop short, as if hitting an invisible wall. It let out a low growl and stepped back. Then it tried again, and again, each time recoiling just on the border, as if in pain. \
Ward stumbled backwards on his hands into the center of the circle, heart racing. The static returned - faint this time, like a memory. The ground beneath him warm, but steady and unmoving. \
The boar began circling the perimeter, pacing and snorting. But it didn't enter. It couldn't. \
Ward stayed inside. He didn't dare leave. The sun dipped below the trees, and the shadows grew long. The boar remained, watching, relentless. \
Night fell. Ward lay curled on the dry ground, the warmth beneath him seeping into his skin. Despite the fear, despite the beast just beyond the stones, he found himself drifting into sleep. The circle, once a place of terror, now felt... comforting. Safe, even.

Ward woke with dawn, the boar gone. \
From that day on, Ward visited the circle more often. At first, he came only when the world felt too loud, when he felt pressured, and confined. The silence there, once eerie, became peace. In time, he stopped calling it strange - he started calling it his second home. \
He began staying there hours on end, sometimes even nights. He brought bread and apples, a worm blanket, and a game or two he liked to play. He just sat, legs crossed on the warm ground, letting the quiet sink into his bones. \
Eventually, he built a camp - nothing much at first. Just a few branches leaning into a crude shelter, where he placed his blanket. He carried in tools from the barn when his mother wasn't watching, stood up old planks to make walls over the comforting bare ground, and hung a tarp above to keep out the bright midday sun. \
He never brought anyone there - not even his mother or his sister. It felt wrong to share it. The circle had chosen him, and him alone.

One evening, just as dusk was unfolding into night, Ward had returned after a day of helping in the fields. He ducked through the brush and stepped into the circle. But this time something was different. \
There, in the center of the circle, a bright red fire. It crackled loudly - flames tall and bold, spewing sparks. \
Ward had not lit it - he had never dared to build a fire there. \
There was no woodpile. No match or stick - just the fire over the bare dirt. \
Ward stood at the edge, heart hammering - not in fear, but something deeper. In recognition. \
Then the voice came. Not spoken or heard - felt. Like a thought that wasn't his. \
_'You return. You linger. You stay.'_ \
Ward's chest tightened, he opened his mouth to speak, but no word came out. \
_"You seek comfort, shelter, meaning. I offer."_ \
The flames rose slightly - just enough to illuminate the circle fully, the stones casting long shadows like daggers pointing outwards. \
_'Say the words, and be made part'_ \
Ward's mouth felt dry, his limbs heavy yet he uttered \
"What words?", Unsure if they were even said out loud. \
The fire pulsed and phrases formed in his mind, like a long memory drifting up. \
He didn't understand it, but the promise the fire made was enough for him to take the leap. \
A weight settled on his shoulders once again. He felt the warm ground's heartbeat synchronize with his, like that first time. His resistance thinned.

"I Ward of Finnsgate, " Ward began saying, the words not his, but their intent is his will. \
"Vow to decline the canvas, the false veil stretched to mimic meaning," The words meant nothing to him, though they felt appropriate. \
"To shun the Weavers, whose fingers stitch illusions into thought," The flames turned white-hot, then deepened to a steady violet. \
"And to scorn imitation of the Divide, and cast it into stillness." \
As he spoke the last word, the fire flamed inwards - folding into itself like a shutting eye. Then it vanished - no smoke, no coal. It left behind a final message in ash. \
_'Spoken, Herald. You are now known.'_ \
Ward blinked, his mouth dry, his heart fast. \
The circle was empty, silent, leaving Ward not fully understanding the meaning of what just occurred.
