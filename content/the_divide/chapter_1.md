For two years, the land refused them. The house stood, the land lay, but nothing grew in their fields. Maybe they made a mistake. Maybe the land is trying to tell them something. \
Hilda and her husband moved into their new property just on the top of Crook Hill, and since then, they built their house and made it their new home. \
They tended to their land with devotion, breaking up the soil and enriching it with fertilizers just after the first thaw. In early spring, they planted the seeds, watering them carefully, waiting for the first sign of growth that never came.

"Dark magic," Hilda had insisted to her husband. \
He only laughed. He knew better. There was no such thing as magic-dark or otherwise. \
Although she had never seen dark magic herself, she had heard stories from her friends about the times they had - or at least, believed they had. And each time, they talked about it for weeks on end, re-telling the same stories with hushed voices over afternoon tea. \
One story came to mind now as she surveyed her infertile land - Emellia's story. \
The first time Emellia told it, it was just the two of them - sitting by the fireplace one evening. Emellia's voice had been steady, but there was something *off* in her eyes - a glimmer of fear that had yet to fade.

"It was Owen," she said. \
_Owen had been their dog. A good dog - loyal, protective, friendly to the family and friends. He had helped herd the sheep from the time he was a pup, played well with the children, and kept the house safe. When a tumor took root in his leg, they did everything they could for him, but in the end, it wasn't enough. Owen died one winter evening, and they buried him in the cold hard ground, with the same care they would have given to any family member. \
Ten days later, he came back._

Hilda pulled her shawl tighter around her shoulders as the cold evening breeze bit through her dress. She stepped back from the dead patch of saplings in front of her. \
No root had taken hold. Again, nothing had survived. \
Like poor Owen, she thought.

_The Owen-thing had crawled into their house at night, its nails scraping against the floorboards. Emellia woke up to the sounds of her son screaming. She and her husband  \
rushed to his room to discover it lying at the foot of his bed. \
It stank - rotting fur and decaying meat - a smell that hung in the air and seeped into the walls. Where its eyes had once been, there were only black, empty sockets. It didn't bark. It only made a shallow rattling gasp, like something choking on breath it no longer needed._

Hilda closed her eyes for a moment, swallowing her unease. \
She wasn't Emellia. She wasn't dealing with a _thing_ like that, crawling out of a grave. \
But then again, maybe she was. Maybe the land, where they built their house - their home - was itself a corpse, refusing to stay buried. \
She turned towards the house. If it was magic, she needed someone who could undo it.

Hilda pressed the notice against the town's message board, pinning it firmly into place.

---
	**Help Wanted** \
	In lifting and removing a curse. \
	Reward to be discussed upon arrival. \
	Atop Crook Hill. \

She hesitated, then let her hand fall away.

_"Desperation is what made me approach him," Emellia had told her once. \
The market had been crowded that day, and yet he moved like a shadow, slipping between the stalls as if even the objects themselves feared to touch him. \
Emellia had never believed the stories either - not until she saw him herself. \
The robes he wore looked heavy and cumbersome, but still, he moved with a cat-like agility. \
The runes on his necklace caught the sunlight for only a moment - their symbols unfamiliar, sharp, and unsettling. \
Everything about the man told her to stay away. And yet, against every instinct, she approached him. \
"The Keeper," she told Hilda._

It is a name known through bedtime tales, and horror stories told over campfires. He was no wandering hedge-witch, nor a royal sorcerer. He was worse - a force to be reckoned with, the thing that answered when no one else would. \
Desperate, Emellia had asked for his help. And he had answered.

Hilda stepped back from the board, almost bumping into a passerby. \
She doubted anyone would come. She doubted he would come. \
But still, each morning, she found herself checking - making sure the notice still hung, replacing it if it wasn't.

Eventually, one morning at sunrise, Hilda stepped outside and glanced towards the field - as she always did. There, she noticed him - a man sat on the old bench by the path, still as a statue. His heavy dark cloak enveloped him and, even from a distance, she could see the dull gleam of metal-runes etched into the pendants hanging from his neck.

She had nearly given up hope - but her notice caught his eye. He was here. The Keeper. Hilda leaned against the door-frame, took a deep breath, and approached him. \
"You put up the notice," he said, his voice low and even. \
Hilda nodded, forcing herself to hold his gaze. "I did." \
He tilted his head, as if considering something. "Tell me what you need done."

For all the considerations she had for the past few weeks, the actual moment caught her off guard. She had been certain that it was dark magic that plagued her land. But now, standing in front of the man who - if the stories are to be trusted - traveled the land, banishing the unimaginable, her words felt almost childish. She glanced towards the field once again.

"The land won't take," she finally said. "Two years, and nothing grows. Not seeds, not saplings - nothing. It just all shrivels up and dies days after it is planted."The Keeper didn't react, his gaze following Hilda's towards the field. "Show me." \
There was not skepticism in his voice, no questions of whether she was sure, and no  \
judgment of her observation. Just a simple command. \
Hilda exhaled, some of the pent-up pressure and uncertainty easing. Without another word, the Keeper stood up and started following Hilda towards the field.

Hilda led him past the weathered wooden gate her husband had made when they bought the land and through the paths stretching over the field. She paused, pressing a hand to her lower back for a moment before continuing.

_For his services, Emellia told her, she had to pay a price. Although she never told Hilda what it was, she did mention it was something she accepted only as a last resort. \
She had given him something - it wasn't silver, nor land, or labor. He said that when it was time, he would come to collect. And eventually, she woke up to discover her home smelling of copper and wet earth, and knew the debt had been paid. The Keeper did not take what wasn't his - only what they had agreed upon._

Hilda didn't know what the Keeper would ask of her, and she didn't know how much she was willing to give. But she came this far, and had to see it through.

Hilda stopped at the latest patch of saplings, her voice tinged with frustration. \
"We planted these three days ago." \
The Keeper crouched by the dead plants, reaching out without touching them. He then let out a deep groan. Hilda, not wanting to disturb his work, stood back and observed. \
The Keeper took a stick from the ground and, using it, etched a few symbols on the earth - similar in nature to those he wore around his neck. \
"It wasn't like that when we planted them," she said, "the ground, I mean. It wasn't that dry. We had tilled the land before planting those saplings and watered them after, and it just... didn't take." \
"I understand. I did not imply you do not know your trade." The Keeper said plainly.

He closed his eyes tightly and let his palm hover over the engraved symbols. \
For a few seconds, nothing happened. Then, a faint shimmer passed over the ground, so  \
quick and subtle that Hilda almost thought she imagined it. \
Hilda frowned, placing a protective hand over her stomach without thinking.

The Keeper rose to his feet, his brow furrowed. He wiped the symbols off the dirt with his shoe. \
"Your land is hollowed," The Keeper finally said. \
"Hollowed? What does it mean?" \
"It is wounded," he explained. "Something took your ground's life - took its fertility." \
Hilda felt a deep unease settle in her bones. "Can you fix it?"

The Keeper studied the ground for a long moment, his gaze heavy - weighing something unseen. Then, he tilted his head slightly. \
"Yes. I will find the source and contain it." \
Relief filled her chest for a moment. \
His voice was calm, almost detached, as he added, "But the land must be repaid." \
"Umm... we don't have much, but we can offer some coin-" \
"Not for me," he interrupted, his voice patient but firm. "For the land. To restore the ground's life, you must provide something - 'A life for a life'." \
Shock washed over Hilda, and her face turned pale in an instant.  \
"Do not misunderstand me. It is a contract - not an exchange. The life is a promise - it can be deferred, for a later time." \
A cold weight settled in Hilda's stomach, and her hand moved instinctively to her stomach, fingers pressing against the fabric of her dress, realizing the Keeper's intents. \
The gesture did not go unnoticed by the Keeper.

"You are with child," he stated, not as a question, but as a fact already settled. "That is life yet to come." \
Hilda took a step back, shaking her head. "No," she said, her voice shaking, barely above a whisper. "That's not - that's not something I can give you." \
"Not for me - for the land. Your land." The Keeper sighed - the kind of sigh that suggested he had seen this kind of resistance before, and heard the same protests from different voices over the years. \
"You will carry your child to fruition. You will raise them," the Keeper explained, his tone as even as if he were discussing the weather. "And when the time comes, they will be called. And when they are called, I will come to collect them." \
Hilda clenched her fists. "Called for what?" \
"Called to complete the contract. To make it final." he said simply.

That night, Hilda and her husband stayed at their neighbor's house, leaving their land to the care of the Keeper as he instructed. Hilda had expected that, as Emellia told her that they had stayed with their family on the other side of town. \
But what really scared her was what was expected to come after.

_Emellia told her that on that night, a sound came - a loud screech, metal grinding against metal, drilling into her skull. She said it felt like it lasted an eternity, one she would never forget. That torture spanned the whole night. Then, at dawn, it all suddenly stopped. When they had returned to the house, it smelled of burned herbs and something bitter she couldn't quite place. And the Owen-thing was gone._

As darkness fell, a long hum filled the air, deep and low, vibrating through the walls. It was followed by whispers—hundreds of voices, layered upon each other and only increasing in magnitude as the minutes went by. The ground itself groaned and creaked, like wood bending under an immense weight. The sound of something shifting slowly, pressed against the edges of her hearing—scraping, scratching, unraveling, seemed to always come from just around the corner. \
And then, silence. \
The next morning, the land was quiet. And the Keeper was gone, leaving Hilda guessing when he would return to collect her unborn child.
