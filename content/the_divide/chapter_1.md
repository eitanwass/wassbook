For two years, the land refused them. No matter what they did, what they tried, nothing would grow. Maybe they made a mistake. Maybe the land was trying to tell them something.\
Hilda and her husband moved into their new property on top of Crook Hill where they built a house and made it their new home.\
With the house came the new responsibility of becoming farmers, to make a living for themselves.\
They tended to their land with almost-religious devotion, breaking up the soil and fertilizing it with the best available just after the first thaw. In early spring, they planted the seeds, watering them in precise measurements, waiting for the first sign of growth that never came.

"Dark magic," Hilda had insisted to her husband.\
He only laughed. He knew that there was no such thing as magic - dark or otherwise. They shouldn't offload their fault onto "mystical powers" or "forces beyond their comprehension". They have been doing something wrong, and needed to find out what.\
Although she had never seen the dark magic herself, Hilda had heard stories from her friends about the times they had - or at least, believed they had. And whenever something remotely strange happened, they entertained themselves with the story for weeks on end, exaggerating the details in each re-telling, in hushed voices over afternoon tea.\
One story came to mind now as she surveyed her infertile land - Emellia's story.\
The first time Emellia told it, it was just the two of them - sitting by the fireplace one evening. Emellia's voice had been steady, but there was something _off_ in her eyes - a glimmer of fear that had yet to fade.

"It was Owen," she said.\
_Owen was their dog. He was a good dog - loyal, protective, and friendly to the family and friends. He had helped herd the sheep from the time he was a pup, played well with the children, and kept the house safe from strangers. When a tumor took root in his leg, they did everything they could for the poor thing, but in the end it just wasn't enough. Owen died on one winter evening, and they buried him in the cold hard ground, with the same care they would have given to a family member.\
Ten days later, he came back._

Hilda pulled her shawl tighter around her shoulders as the cold evening breeze bit through her dress. She dug out the dead saplings at her feet to find their roots black and smelling of mold. With a sigh, she stepped back and kicked the sick plant away from the rest of the patch.

_The "Owen-thing" had crawled into Emellia's house at night, its nails scraping against the floorboards as it pulled itself slowly. Emellia woke up to her son's screams. She and her husband\
rushed to his room to find it lying at the foot of his bed.\
It stank - rotting fur and decaying meat - a smell that filled the air and seeped into the furniture. Where its eyes had once been, were only black, empty sockets. As they entered, it tried to bark, but instead it only made a shallow rattling gasp, like something choking on breath it no longer needed._

Hilda closed her eyes for a moment, swallowing her unease as the image came back to her.\
She wasn't Emellia. She wasn't dealing with a _thing_ like that, crawling out of a grave. She must have been mistaken - this is not some dark magic. This was just mishandling of their crops.\
But then again, maybe she was right. Maybe the land was itself a corpse, refusing to stay buried.\
She turned towards the house. If it was magic, she needed someone who could undo it.

Hilda decided to take action. She wrote a notice:

---

    **Help Wanted**
    In lifting and removing a curse.
    Reward to be discussed upon arrival.
    Atop Crook Hill.

---

She went to the market early, earlier than the stall owners' opening time, as to not arouse curiosity and unwanted attention. As Hilda approached the wooden notice board at the village center, she hesitated to hang it.

_"Desperation made me approach him," Emellia told her once.\
The market had been crowded that day, and yet he was slipping between the stalls as if even the objects themselves feared to touch him.\
Emellia had never believed the stories either - not until she saw him with her own eyes, and she understood when Hilda snickered at her seemingly exaggerated description of him.\
The robes he wore looked heavy and cumbersome, but still, he moved with a cat-like agility.\
The iron runes on his necklace caught the sunlight for only a moment - their symbols unfamiliar, sharp, and odd.\
Everything about the man told her to stay away. And yet, against every instinct, she approached him.\
"The Keeper, was his name," she told Hilda._

It is a name once told in bedtime tales, and horror stories told over campfires. He was no wandering hedge-witch, nor a royal sorcerer. He was worse - a force to be reckoned with, the thing that answered when all prayers ran out.\
Desperate, Emellia had asked for his help. And he had answered.

Hilda attached the notice to the board and stepped back.\
She doubted anyone would come. She doubted he would come. But still, each morning, she found herself checking - making sure the notice still hung, and replaced it when it fell or got removed.

One early morning, Hilda stepped outside and breathed in the morning air. There, she noticed him - the figure sat on the old bench by the path, still as a statue. His heavy dark cloak enveloped him and, even from a distance, she could see the dull gleam of metal runes hanging from his neck. It was clear to her it was him - The Keeper. Hilda leaned against the door-frame, took a deep breath, and approached him carefully.\
"You put up the notice," he said, his voice low and even.\
"I did." Hilda nodded, forcing herself to hold his gaze. His eyes were light blue as the sky, and felt like they could pierce metal. His nose, crooked a bit to the left. On his cheek were black marks of coal. His face was completely clean shaven, and no hair could be seen from under his hood.\
He tilted his head, as if considering something. "Tell me what you need done."

For all the considerations she had for the past few weeks, the actual moment caught her off guard. She was certain that it was dark magic that plagued her land. But now, standing in front of the man who - if the stories are to be trusted - had seen the unimaginable, banished the unnatural, and killed the undead, her words felt almost childish. She glanced towards the fields.

"The land won't take," she said. "Two years, and nothing grows. Seeds won't sprout, saplings wither and die. Nothing works no matter how much we try. And I am certain we are doing everything right. I believe it is dark magic, but my husband... He cannot know I called for you."\
The Keeper expression blank, his gaze following Hilda's towards the field. "Show me."\
There was not skepticism in his voice, no questions of whether she was sure, and no\
judgment of her observation. Just a simple command.\
Hilda exhaled, some of the pent-up pressure and uncertainty easing. Without another word, the Keeper stood up and started following Hilda towards the field.

Hilda led him past the weathered wooden gate her husband had made when they bought the land and through the paths stretching over the field. She paused, leaning against the fence and pressing a hand to her lower back for a moment before continuing.

_For his services, Emellia told her, she had to pay a price. Though she never told Hilda what it was, she did mention it was something she accepted only as a last resort.\
She had given him something - it wasn't silver, nor land, or labor. He said that when it was time, he would come to collect. One day, she woke up to discover her home smelling of copper and wet earth, and knew the debt had been paid. The Keeper was in her home but he did not take what wasn't his - only what was promised to him._

Hilda didn't know what the Keeper would ask of her, and she didn't know how much she was willing to give. But she came this far, and had to see it through.

Hilda stopped at the last patch of saplings, her voice tinged with frustration.\
"We planted these three days ago."\
The Keeper crouched by the dead plants, reaching out an open hand without touching them. Hilda, not wanting to disturb his work, stood back and observed.\
The Keeper took a stick from the ground and, using it, etched a few symbols on the earth - similar in nature to those he wore around his neck.\
"It wasn't like that when we planted them," she said, "the ground, I mean. It wasn't that dry. We had tilled the land before planting and watering the saplings, then it just... didn't take."\
"I understand. I did not imply you do not know your trade." The Keeper said plainly.

He closed his eyes tightly and let his palm hover over the engraved symbols.\
For a few seconds, nothing happened. Then, a faint shimmer passed over the ground, so\
quick and subtle that Hilda almost thought she imagined it.\
Hilda frowned, placing a protective hand over her stomach without thinking.

The Keeper rose to his feet, his brow furrowed. He wiped the symbols off the dirt with his boot.\
"Your land is hollowed," The Keeper finally said.\
"Hollowed? What does it mean?"\
"It is wounded," he explained. "Something stole your ground's life - took its fertility. Nothing can live on it. You should leave."\
Hilda felt a deep unease settle in her bones. "Leave? Go where? Can't you fix it?"

The Keeper studied the ground for a long moment, weighing something unseen. Then, he tilted his head slightly.\
"I will try to find the source and contain it. You should still pack up your belongings in case I fail."\
Relief filled her chest for a moment.\
His voice was calm, almost detached, as he added, "But for it to succeed, the land must be repaid."\
"Umm... we don't have much, but we can offer some coin-"\
"Not for me," he interrupted, his voice patient but firm. "For the land, and I has no need for coin. To restore the ground's life, in demands an appropriate pay - 'A life for a life'."\
Shock washed over Hilda, and her face turned pale in an instant.\
"Do not misunderstand me. It is a contract - not an exchange. The life is a promise - and it can be deferred for a later time."\
A cold weight settled in Hilda's stomach, and her hand moved instinctively to her stomach, fingers pressing against the fabric of her dress, realizing the Keeper's intents.\
The gesture did not go unnoticed by the Keeper.

"You are with child," he stated, not as a question, but as a fact already settled. "That is life yet to come."\
Hilda took a step back, shaking her head. "No," she said, her voice shaking, barely above a whisper. "That's not - that's not something I can give you."\
"Not for me - for the land. Your land." The Keeper sighed - the kind of sigh that suggested he had seen this kind of resistance before, and heard the same protests from different voices.\
"You will carry your child to birth fully. And you will raise them as you naturally would," the Keeper explained, his tone as even as if he were discussing the weather. "But, when the time comes, you will be called on this promise. And when that happens, I will come to collect them."\
Hilda clenched her fists tight to her face, tears flowing through her knuckles. But there was no other option - it was either that or leave behind everything her husband and she worked so hard for for so long.\
So she agreed.

That night, Hilda and her husband stayed at their neighbor's house, leaving their home to the care of the Keeper as instructed. Hilda expected that, Emellia told her she stayed with her family on the other side of town the night the Keeper came.\
But what really scared her was what was expected to happen next.

_Emellia told her that on that night, a sound came - a loud screech, metal grinding against metal, drilling into her skull. It felt like it lasted an eternity, one she would never forget. That torture spanned the whole sleepless night. Then, a little after dawn, it suddenly stopped. When they had finally returned to the house, it smelled of burned herbs and something bitter she couldn't quite place. And the "Owen-thing" was gone._

As darkness fell, a long hum filled the air, deep and low, vibrating through the walls. It was followed by whispers—hundreds of voices, layered on each other and only increasing in volume as the minutes went by. The ground itself groaned and creaked, like wood being forced to bend under an immense weight. The sound of something shifting slowly, pressed against the edges of her hearing—scraping, scratching, unraveling, that seemed to always come from just around the corner.\
And then, silence.\
The next morning, the land was quiet. And the Keeper was gone, leaving Hilda guessing when he would return to collect her unborn child.
