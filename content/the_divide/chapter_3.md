The house smelled of steeped herbs and the faint aroma of freshly baked bread. Ward kicked the dirt from his boots before taking them off at the doorstep. Stepping inside, instead of the expected hum of his mother's work, he found her sitting at the table - and she wasn't alone. \
Across from her sat a man. He seemed _aged_ - not old or frail, but worn, like leather that had been left too long in the sun. His cloak, heavy and dark, draped over the man and the chair, making them into a single shaded shape. \
Even seated, he seemed to tower over Ward and his mother, filling the space in a way that made the room feel smaller. \
The candlelight flickered on the table, casting a warm glow over his mother's face - a light that seemed to skip the man's features, as the shadows stretched strangely around him - bending as if unwilling to let go.

"Ward," His mother stood from the table, wrapping him in a firm hug, holding just a little longer than usual.  \
"This is, um..." she hesitated, searching for a name, for a softer way to present the man sitting before them. But there was none.  \
She exhaled. "This is the Keeper." \
Ward looked at the man, and mouthed the name - the Keeper. The title felt strange - more suited to something ancient than a person sitting at their table. \
The Keeper said nothing. He only watched Ward back, his eyes sharp, piercing, as if measuring him up. \
Ward shifted uncomfortably. "Alright," he said, glancing towards his mother for some kind of explanation, some reassurance. But her hands were clasped together, knuckles white, and she wouldn't meet his eyes. She was holding herself back from crying. \
Then the Keeper spoke. "I have come to take you with me, child." \
The words landed like stones on Ward's chest. He turned back to the Keeper, his voice was exactly as he had expected - raspy, cold, strong. \
Ward swallowed hard. "Take me where?" his eyes snapping between his mother and the Keeper.  \
"Why? Are you coming too, mom?" \
His mother didn't answer. Instead, she averted her gaze, a tear escaping from her eye and running down her cheek. \
The Keeper stood, at his full stature he looked even more menacing. "Just us. You'll get your answers on the way and in due time, but we leave soon. We have a long way to the nearest camp, so eat your supper, say your goodbyes, and we will be on our way."

Ward took a hesitant step back. \
"No." The word slipped. His heart pounded. "No, no, no. I am not going anywhere." \
His focus flickered rapidly between the Keeper and his mother searching for an explanation. \
The Keeper didn't move. He didn't even look surprised. \
"We need to leave tonight, kid," he repeated, his voice unmoved by Ward's pleads. \
Ward turned to his mother. She wasn't arguing, she wasn't fighting it. She had already given him up. \
Ward flashed her a look of anger mixed with betrayal. \
No. I will not go. \
His feet moved before his mind could catch up. \
He bolted through the door, into the cold night air. His heel clipped the shoes he had left on the porch, nearly sending him down to the ground. He steadied himself and ran, his bare feet pounding against the dirt.  \
Away from the house. Away from the Keeper. Away from whatever _this_ was. \
He didn't know where he was going - only that he had to run. \
Branches scraped his arms, stones bit into his feet, but he didn't stop - he couldn't.  \
As he ran, Ward spotted something between the trees - a faint fog, blowing in the same direction he was going, distorting and contorting the trees it flew by. It passed him by quickly, and Ward disregarded it for the moment. \
His chest burned, his pulse roared in his ears, but he pushed forward. \
Then he recognized where he was - near the clearing - _his_ clearing.  \
He was brought by his instincts to his safe place, now he could finally relax.

Pushing through the overgrown vegetation surrounding the bare stone circle, he saw the thing he dreaded. A fire crackled at the center of the clearing, the familiar strange flames swaying gently. \
Beside it, stoking the fire with a stick and sitting on a tree stump, as if he had been there for hours - the Keeper. \
Ward skidded to a halt, breathless, exhausted, bracing on his knees.  \
He ran fast - faster than fast, he left the Keeper far behind, didn't he? \
"Please. Sit." The Keeper gestured to the ground beside the fire. His voice unchanged, steady, certain. \
"Ward, we have a lot to talk about."

Ward and the Keeper sat in silence on opposite ends around the fire. \
Ward's feet still sore from running. His breath caught already, but his heart still racing. He refused to look the Keeper in the eye, as a small act of defiance in the only way he felt he had control of at the moment. \
"You ran well. Longer than I thought you would. That ought to count for something," The Keeper said, attempting to ease the tension. \
"You are angry, and you have every right to be. A stranger walks into your home, tells you to leave everything behind and go with him...  and your mother just agrees. Without explanation." \
Ward shut his eyes tight, smothering a sob. \
"If it is any consolation, know this: your mother cares for you. She didn't just hand you over like coins at the market. She pleaded - a lot." \
Ward's voice cracked as he whispered, "I don't blame her. You didn't leave her a choice." \
The fire popped, sending up sparks. Its light reflected in the tears welling in Ward's eyes. He blinked hard and wiped them off with the back of his sleeve. \
"Look, kid," the Keeper said, his voice softer now, "If you stay here, you will die. That is not a threat - just a fact. And while I refused to be the one to kill you, someone, or something, will." \
"But why?" Ward snapped, raising his voice, "Why would anyone want to kill me? I haven't done anything! Why should I even believe you?" \
"It is not about what you have done. Your life was bartered for something before you were even born - traded for something far beyond your current understanding. I am here because I was called to collect that debt." \
He paused, weighing his decision once more, "But I do not want to bury another child, so I encourage you to come with me." \
Ward balled-up, drawing his knees to his chest. \
"And you say I'll be safe with you?" he muttered. "Why should I believe that?" \
"You won't be safe, not really. The contract still binds you, and it will continue to hunt you. I cannot offer you safety - but I do offer you purpose, answers, a chance to learn why the world acts the way it does, and, hopefully, a chance to survive what comes your way."  \
The Keeper fell silent as he finished his argument, giving Ward time to breath, and to decide. \
Slowly, Ward lifted his head. \
"I believe you, but I still don't trust you," \
His fists idly grabbing the dirt, rubbing it between his fingers. \
"But I'll come. I'll go because even though you make it out like It's my choice,  I don't really have other options and I got nowhere else to go now." \
"You have made the right choice, kid," The Keeper said, with a faint hint of relief. "You should turn in for the night. We have a long way to go tomorrow."

Ward flipped over and curled beside the fire. He stayed awake long after the Keeper went silent, weighing his decision over and over, wondering if he should run while the Keeper sleeps. \
But with his muscles aching and his eyes stinging, exhaustion won. There was no rush. He could always go back on his decision and just go. \
Ward turned over once more.

Ward woke to birdsong and the crackle of dying coals. He opened his eyes to pale sunshine filtered through the trees. For a moment, he forgot where he was. \
Then he saw the Keeper - crouching beside the fire, tracing symbols into the ash with a smoking stick. \
"You're awake, good," the Keeper said without looking towards him. "Come, we have a direction to find." \
Ward stood stiffly, stretching his back and rubbing his eyes. "What do you mean?" \
Instead of answering, the Keeper reached into the dying campfire and grabbed a handful of still-steaming ashes. \
He straightened. In the daylight, he looked far less menacing than he had the night before - Ward thought. Now, he mostly looked... frail. The cloak that seemed to capture light now hung loosely over his bony shoulders, and the heavy trinkets at his neck pulled him into a slight hunch. \
"This is an old way to do this," he said. "The land fears fire and remembers ash." \
He held the ashes in both hands and threw them into the air. They scattered - but instead of drifting aimlessly, the flecks whipped sideways, as if caught in an invisible current. They swirled briefly, then flowed eastward, coiling like smoke through the treetops. \
"There, " the Keeper said, pointing westward. "We go that way." \
Ward stared after the ash remnants. "Where's it going? Why aren't we following it?" \
"The ashes are drawn toward something to the east. Something we would rather not meet." \
Without waiting for more questions, he began walking in large steps towards the trees. \
Ward lingered for a final moment, then followed close behind.
